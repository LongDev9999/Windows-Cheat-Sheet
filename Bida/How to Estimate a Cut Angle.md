## How to Estimate a Cut Angle

On [Vol. I](https://drdavebilliards.com/veps/disc-i/) of the [Video Encyclopedia of Pool Shots](https://drdavebilliards.com/veps/), we show how to **use your hand** to recognize 1/4-ball, 1/2-ball, and 3/4-ball hits. We also show how to calibrate your hand so you can judge these shots (and the corresponding cut angles) fairly accurately. Knowing these three angles well can help you estimate the angle required for any shot. “[HAPS – Part I: Fractional-Ball Aiming](https://billiards.colostate.edu/bd_articles/2014/nov14.pdf)” (BD, November, 2014) also has diagrams and illustrations that help you visualize and practice standard ball-hit fractions. The cut angles for various ball-hit fractions can be found at the end of [TP A.23](https://billiards.colostate.edu/technical_proofs/new/TP_A-23.pdf).

A simple way to visualize and estimate cut angles is to imagine an **analog clock face** (or use one on your wrist). If noon (12) is straight (0°), 11 and 1 are at 30° (1/2-ball hit), 10 and 2 are at 60° (about an 1/8-ball hit), and each minute is 6°. For example, halfway between 12 and 1 ( at 2 1/2 minutes) is 15° (about a 3/4-ball hit), and halfway between 1 and 2 is 45° (about a 1/4-ball hit).

Other methods for visualizing cut angles can be found on the [fractional-ball aiming](https://billiards.colostate.edu/faq/aiming/fractional/) resource page. Here’s a diagram from Patrick Johnson illustrating the where the ball-hit fractions are relative to clock hours:

Below is a **template** from Dan Traylor (from “oldschool1478” in [AZB post](https://forums.azbilliards.com/showthread.php?t=281433)) that can be useful to estimate cut angles and required aim points when practicing. Here’s a [printable PDF version](https://billiards.colostate.edu/resource_files/oldschool_cut-angle_template.pdf). If the center of the cutout is placed over the necessary ghost-ball position with the arrow pointed back to the cue ball, sighting to the pocket gives the necessary cut angle, clock position, ghost-ball overlap, and aim point (center of small circle) relative to the object ball. For example, the required aim for a 30° cut (assuming no throw) is through the edge of the object ball. The dashed ghost-balls in the small illustrations are useful to get a sense for the amount of ball overlap required on a particular shot.

[AimPro Billiards](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCPy69FY1TF_b0Fi9Kg33kXw) has a similar easy-to-use plastic template and system called *AimRight* that can be used to estimate cut angles, ball-hit fractions, and CB directions. [CueAndMe](https://cueandme.com/) also has useful templates and a system for estimating cut angles by visualizing rectangles of different proportions.

> If you place your tip at the center of the ghost ball and pivot around it from the line to the pocket to the line of the shot (over the cue ball), the number of inches the bumper on the cue travels is the number of degrees of the cut angle.

> To be precise, you should measure the distance around the arc of the travel of the bumper, but for cut angles up to 30 degrees the straight-line distance between the two positions of the bumper is pretty close.

> The tip of the cue is at the center of the ghost ball. The distance X is the base of an isosceles triangle. If X is measured in quarter inches, it gives the angle, pretty nearly.
